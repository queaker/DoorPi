#[<kb_alias>_OutputPins]
# This section contains definitions in the form of

# This sections contains definitions in the form of

#[EVENT_<eventname>]
# Instead of defining single actions inline in [<kb_alias>_InputPins] or [DTMF], you can
# use these event blocks to fire multiple actions in order.
# Each event block contains definitions in the form of
#   <order> = <action>
# <order> is an arbitrary key used to order the actions, two numeric digits recommended
# <action> is an action definition of the form
#   <type>:<parameters>
# with <parameters> being a comma separated list of parameters, and <action> one of:
# - call:<address>
#       Call the specified SIP address (ex: 'call:**613#614')
# - out:<pin_alias>,<value>[,<stop_value>,<hold_time>[,<interrupt>]]
#       set output pin <pin_alias> to <value>
#       after <hold_time> seconds elapse, set it to <stop_value>
#       if input pin <interrupt> is triggered, cancel the timer
# - os_execute:<command>
#       execute <command> with /bin/sh
# - mailto:<receiver>,<subject>,<message>,<snapshot>
#       send a mail to <receiver>, with subject <subject> and message body <message>
#       if <snapshot> is True, attach the latest snapshot
# - sleep:<time>
#       wait <time> seconds before continuing
# - hangup:<time>
#       wait <time> seconds, then hang up the active SIP call
# - file_call_value:<file>
#       call the SIP address specified in <file>
# - log:<message>
#       print <message> into the log file
# - take_snapshot:
#       take a snapshot
# An example event definition might look like this:
#[EVENT_OnKeyDown_<kb_alias>_7]
## switch on lights
#20 = out:lights,1
## take a snapshot of the person outside
## the snapshot may be displayed on a wall-mounted tablet inside the house,
